Should you wish to populate the system with game content for your own use please purchase the rules from Free League Publishing: <a href="https://frialigan.se/en/games/alien/">Free League - Alien RPG</a> or better still purchase the Starter Set or Core Rules modules. <br /><br />

My intention is to enable people to play Alien RPG remotely and not to create a fully enabled/automated system. MO/TH/ER will still need to do some work. <br /><br /> <b>Official Modules:</b><br /> Save the effort of inputting all the data from the books by purchasing the official modules from Free League: <br />
